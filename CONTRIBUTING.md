### Writing Tests

#### Unit Tests
```typescript
// Example unit test
import { calculateSplit } from '@/lib/calculations';

describe('calculateSplit', () => {
  it('should split amount equally among participants', () => {
    const result = calculateSplit({
      amount: 120,
      type: 'equal',
      participants: ['user1', 'user2', 'user3']
    });
    
    expect(result).toEqual([
      { userId: 'user1', amount: 40 },
      { userId: 'user2', amount: 40 },
      { userId: 'user3', amount: 40 }
    ]);
  });
});
```

#### Component Tests
```typescript
// Example component test
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
import ExpenseModal from '@/components/modals/expense-modal';

describe('ExpenseModal', () => {
  it('should show validation errors for invalid input', async () => {
    render(<ExpenseModal isOpen onClose={jest.fn()} />);
    
    const submitButton = screen.getByRole('button', { name: /create expense/i });
    fireEvent.click(submitButton);
    
    expect(await screen.findByText(/description is required/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

#### API Tests
```typescript
// Example API test
import request from 'supertest';
import { app } from '@/server';

describe('POST /api/expenses', () => {
  it('should create a new expense', async () => {
    const response = await request(app)
      .post('/api/expenses')
      .send({
        description: 'Dinner',
        amount: 50.00,
        currency: 'USD'
      })
      .expect(201);
    
    expect(response.body).toHaveProperty('id');
    expect(response.body.description).toBe('Dinner');
  });
});
